# Exploring Hotwiring Rails with Turbo, Stimulus, and More

I created this project by following the guidance from the [Hotwiring Rails Book](https://book.hotwiringrails.com/). Throughout this experience, I learned a lot about:

Turbo: Boosting the user experience with Turbo Drive, Frames, and Streams.
Stimulus: Using Stimulus for creating interactive and responsive front-end elements.
Stimulus Reflex: Integrating real-time features seamlessly with Stimulus Reflex.
Cable Ready: Discovering the power of Cable Ready for easy WebSocket updates.

I'm really excited about this tech stack and plan to build a complete full-stack app with it.
